# QRCODE

**QR Code Generator and Error Correction Implementation**

*Description:*
As a Computer Science student at Rice University, I had the opportunity to work on a significant project involving QR code generation and Reed-Solomon error correction. This project demonstrates my proficiency in algorithm design and implementation, as well as my ability to work with complex data structures and finite field arithmetic.

**Key Contributions and Responsibilities:**

- **QR Code Generation:** Designed and implemented a QR code generator using Python, capable of encoding data into QR code format.

- **Reed-Solomon Error Correction:** Implemented the Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm to add redundancy and error recovery capability to QR codes. This involved creating generator polynomials and applying them to correct errors in the encoded data.

- **Finite Field Arithmetic:** Utilized modular arithmetic in the finite field Z_256 to ensure correct calculations within the Reed-Solomon error correction algorithm.

- **Polynomial Operations:** Developed a Polynomial class to perform polynomial addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, crucial for both QR code generation and error correction.

- **Optimization:** Optimized the code for efficiency and performance, ensuring fast and accurate QR code generation and error correction.

- **QR Code Testing:** Conducted extensive testing and validation of QR codes generated using the implemented algorithm, including real-world scanning tests to ensure compatibility with QR code readers.

This project not only showcases my programming skills but also demonstrates my ability to tackle challenging problems in computer science, especially in the fields of data encoding, error correction, and algorithm design. It represents my commitment to excellence in software development and my dedication to solving real-world problems with technology.
